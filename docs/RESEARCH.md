# Research Papers & Methodology

This document lists research papers, references, and methodology used in the development of the IPDR Graph Engine.

## Methodology
- Data collection from synthetic and anonymized IPDR datasets
- Feature engineering for anomaly detection
- Model selection: CatBoost, neural networks, ensemble methods
- Evaluation using standard metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
- Visualization and explainability for investigator transparency
