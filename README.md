## 🚩 Problem Statement

Telecoms generate massive IPDR data; manual analysis is overwhelming, inefficient, and inaccessible to non-technical stakeholders.

**Need:** Transform complex IPDR data into actionable intelligence with visual and AI tools.

---


## 💡 Proposed Solution

A web-based, investigator-first platform that ingests heterogeneous IPDR logs, normalizes the data, constructs A→B communication graphs, applies ML-based anomaly detection, and delivers interactive 3D/2D visualizations and auditable reports—all while securely storing IPDR data in encrypted storage.

```

## 🧩 Detailed Solution Explanation

- **Ingest / Upload:**
	- Drag-and-drop or CSV upload with automatic schema detection and data preview.
	- Supports large files and multiple formats (CSV, XLSX, TXT).
	- Real-time data preview and validation.
- **Parse & Normalize:**
	- Universal parser detects schema, extracts entities (IPs, phone numbers, session metadata), and standardizes data.
	- Handles missing values, inconsistent formats, and data cleaning.
	- Converts all logs to a unified internal schema for downstream processing.
- **Graph Mapping:**
	- Build node/edge graphs (A-party/B-party as nodes, sessions as edges).
	- Support for graph analytics (degree, centrality, clustering, shortest path, etc.).
	- Enables interactive exploration of communication patterns.
- **ML Analysis:**
	- ML models flag anomalous sessions and provide confidence scores.
	- Uses CatBoost, neural networks, and custom heuristics.
	- Results are explainable and auditable for investigators.
- **Visualization & Reporting:**
	- Interactive 3D/2D graph visualizations (WebGL, D3.js, React-Force-Graph).
	- Downloadable, auditable reports for investigators (PDF, CSV).
	- Dashboard for historical analysis and case management.
- **Secure Storage:**
	- All IPDR data is encrypted and securely stored for compliance and future analysis.
	- Role-based access control and audit logging.
